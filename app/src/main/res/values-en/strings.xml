This is a Russian-English-Nivkh audio dictionary. The purpose of releasing the dictionary is to preserve (reproduce) the sound form of the East Sakhalin dialect of the Nivkh language. The Nivkh words were voiced by Vladimir Mikhailovich Sangi - a Nivkh writer, creator of the Nivkh alphabet, Laureate of the State Prize of Russia. The correct pronunciation of words in the Nivkh language will remain the standard of sound for many generations of Nivkhs.

We hope that the creation of a talking Nivkh dictionary will help the people in preserving and developing the language, teachers - in organizing classes in the Nivkh language in preschool institutions and general education schools.
